# 🚀 AWS DevOps Infrastructure – Terraform, Kubernetes, Docker & GitLab CI/CD

This repository contains a complete, production-ready DevOps architecture designed using **AWS**, **Terraform**, **Kubernetes (EKS)**, **Docker**, and **GitLab CI/CD**.  
It is based on real-world experience building automated, secure, and highly scalable cloud environments used in production.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project showcases how to design and implement a fully automated cloud infrastructure using:

- **AWS Cloud Infrastructure**
- **Terraform Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**
- **Kubernetes (EKS) for container orchestration**
- **Docker for containerization**
- **GitLab CI/CD for automated deployments**
- **CloudWatch for monitoring & logging**
- **Security best practices (IAM, Networking, Policies)**

The goal is to provide a stable, scalable, secure, and repeatable DevOps workflow suitable for real production workloads.
